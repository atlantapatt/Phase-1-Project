# Grocery List and Meal Idea Generator

## Project Basis
A big problem in my own life is that I'll come back from the grocery store with items that do not go together in a meal or I will spend hours trying to search for what to make. This app is centered around combining a grocery list to track the items you need to buy as well as evading choice paralysis by randomly generating recipies. 

## Project Use
Grocery List is a single page application that allows you to add and cross off items for a grocery list. You can also use the Meal Idea Generator to randomly give you a recipie idea or search up a recipie by utilizing the [The Meal Database](https://www.themealdb.com/).


## How to Use Grocery List
1. Click the input box at the top to start typing items.
2. Press enter or click the pencil to the left to add the item to your grocery list.

3. Once items are added, you can click said item to cross it off the list.
